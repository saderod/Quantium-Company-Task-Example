# Quantium-Company-Task-Example
This was one of the tasks given to me by Quantium. I used Python and Excel to remove take the numbers from the PROD_NAME column into them into their own column so they can be used as an analysis feature. The other task were to remove any outliers. The last task was to remove missing rows in the data. There is no Python function that I can use to do these directly so I had to find a solution of my own. Here is the code I created to solve the problems.
